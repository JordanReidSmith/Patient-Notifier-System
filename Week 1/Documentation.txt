Python JSON Parser

Basic premise is that I created a function that can analyse and handle any line in a JSON file,
then I call it recursively on each subsequent line. 
Could very certainly be changed to a sequential function but not alot of merit to do so.

Needed to brush up on basic Python Syntax,
also needed to install Python 3.10 as I wanted to utilise the Match/Case statement

All the code was written by myself though, so no links are needed.

Deprecated JSON reader function
#def processLine(file, line, titles, depth):
#    if line[-1] == ",":
#        line = line[0:-1]
#    value = line[-1]
#    match value:
#        case "[":
#            titles.append(line.split("\"")[1])
#        case "\"":
#            print(" - ".join(titles) + " - " + line.split("\"")[1] + ": " + line.split("\"")[3])
#
#    parseLine(file, file.readline(), titles, depth)
