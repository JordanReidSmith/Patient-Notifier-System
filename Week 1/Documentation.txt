Python JSON Parser

Basic premise is that I created a function that can analyse and handle any line in a JSON file,
then I call it recursively on each subsequent line. 
Could very certainly be changed to a sequential function but not alot of merit to do so.

Needed to brush up on basic Python Syntax,
also needed to install Python 3.10 as I wanted to utilise the Match/Case statement

All the code was written by myself though, so no links are needed.
